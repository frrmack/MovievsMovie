            <h3 class="text-center">Rating movies is hard</h3>
            <p>Research has shown that when we rate movies, the rating
              depends a lot on what you've seen (or rated) lately, what
              your mood is, which other film experiences come to mind when
              you try to translate your enjoyment to a grade (out of 4, 5,
              10, 100 or any scale). Our memories cannot evalute the
              entirety of all movies we have seen, so every time we rate a
              movie, even though it feels like an ultimate rating, we are
              really comparing it to a limited set. As an example, if we
              are rating a whole bunch of movies in succession, if they
              are all movies we are fond of, our grading becomes a lot
              more strict, without us noticing it. This is because the
              human brain is great at adaptation, pattern recognition, and
              setting a baseline. This is generally very useful, but in
              this case it becomes harder to find out which movies you
              truly like best, or to have a complete, continuous ranking
              that doesn't depend on different conditions of each rating
              session. </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Star rating as a start</h3>
            <p>A star rating (1-5 stars out of 5) is a good starting
              point to get a general idea of where the movie is: towards
              the top, the middle, or the bottom of your
              rankings. However, it does not have enough resolution for a
              continuous ranking, and it is also sensitive to factors
              like our limited memory, which can only compare it to a few
              other movies we focus on, instead of the entire
              rankings. Trying to use a high resolution grading system (like out
              of a hundred or out of ten with a decimal place) makes these
              ratings very sensitive. If you rate two movies on two
              separate days, you may give a 7.8 to film A and 7.5 to film
              B even if you would have said that you like B better than A
              on either day. For a movie, we start by asking you to give a
              star rating out of five. Then, we get a better idea of how
              much you like it by letting you tell us how it does in one
              to one matches against other movies. </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Head to head fights</h3>
            <p> We need to have high resolution, continuous scores for
              all movies to be able ro rank them. Directly rating on a
              high resolution scale is unreliable. Instead, we get to
              higher resolutions through head to head comparisons. When
              you determine the winner (or a draw) of a head to head
              match, the current score of each movie changes according to
              the result. These scores start with the initial star rating
              for each movie. Then, how each score changes depends on the
              previous scores of the competitors. If Casablanca had a
              score of 5.4, and The Matrix had 4, when you say that The
              Matrix beats Casablanca, its score goes up quite a bit,
              whereas Casablanca's score goes down a bit. However, if The
              Godfather has a score of 4.7, and Troll 2 has a score of
              1.4, and The Godfather beats it, the scores don't really
              change much, because that was already an expected
              result. Also, the algorithm learns a lot more from the first
              matches than the hundredth match for a movie, since it
              already has a lot of information about its true score from
              the previous matches. Technically, we use the TrueSkill
              algorithm that we seed by the star ratings as priors. We try
              to bring you matches that will inform the scores and
              converge to the true score as fast as possible. On average,
              the score of a movie converges close to its stable final
              score in about 10 comparisons. </p>
